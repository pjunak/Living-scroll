# Harm
*6th-Level Necromancy (Cleric)*
**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** 60 feet
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash virulent magic on a creature you can see within range. The target makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 Necrotic damage, and its Hit Point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the Necrotic damage it took. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only. This spell can’t reduce a target’s Hit Point maximum below 1.
