# Shocking Grasp
*Evocation Cantrip (Artificer, Sorcerer, Wizard)*
**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** Touch
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Lightning springs from you to a creature that you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 Lightning damage, and it can’t make Opportunity Attacks until the start of its next turn.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach levels 5 (2d8), 11 (3d8), and 17 (4d8).
