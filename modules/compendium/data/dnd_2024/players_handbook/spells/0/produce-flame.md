# Produce Flame
*Conjuration Cantrip (Druid)*
**Casting Time:** Bonus Action
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** 10 minutes

A flickering flame appears in your hand and remains there for the duration. While there, the flame emits no heat and ignites nothing, and it sheds Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet. The spell ends if you cast it again.

Until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action to hurl fire at a creature or an object within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 Fire damage.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach levels 5 (2d8), 11 (3d8), and 17 (4d8).
