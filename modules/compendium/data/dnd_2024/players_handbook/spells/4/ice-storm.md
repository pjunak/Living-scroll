# Ice Storm
*4th-Level Evocation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*
**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** 300 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (a mitten)
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Hail falls in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the Cylinder makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d10 Bludgeoning damage and 4d6 Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Hailstones turn ground in the Cylinder into Difficult Terrain until the end of your next turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The Bludgeoning damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 4.
