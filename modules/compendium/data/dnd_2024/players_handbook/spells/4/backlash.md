# Backlash
*4th-Level Abjuration (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*
**Casting Time:** Reaction
**Range:** 60 feet
**Components:** V
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You ward yourself against destructive energy, reducing the damage taken by 4d6 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

If the triggering damage was from a creature within range, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 4d6 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage reduction and Force damage from this spell both increase by 1d6 for every spell slot level above 4.
