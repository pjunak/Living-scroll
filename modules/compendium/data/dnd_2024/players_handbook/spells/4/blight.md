# Blight
*4th-Level Necromancy (Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*
**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** 30 feet
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Instantaneous

A creature that you can see within range makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 8d8 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A Plant creature automatically fails the save.

Alternatively, target a nonmagical plant that isn’t a creature, such as a tree or shrub. It doesn’t make a save; it simply withers and dies.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 4.
