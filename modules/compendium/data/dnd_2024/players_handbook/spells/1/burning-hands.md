# Burning Hands
*1st-Level Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*
**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Instantaneous

A thin sheet of flames shoots forth from you. Each creature in a 15-foot Cone makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Flammable objects in the Cone that aren’t being worn or carried start burning.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 1.
