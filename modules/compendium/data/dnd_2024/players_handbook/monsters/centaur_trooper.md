**Conjure Infernal Chain.** The devil conjures a fiery chain to bind a creature. Dexterity Saving Throw: DC 15, one creature the devil can see within 60 feet. Failure: 9 (2d4 + 4) Fire damage, and the target has the Restrained condition until the end of the devil’s next turn, at which point the chain disappears.
