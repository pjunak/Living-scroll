**Bite.** Melee Attack Roll: +5, reach 5 ft. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) Piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) Poison damage.

**Petrifying Gaze (Recharge 4–6).** Constitution Saving Throw: DC 12, each creature in a 30-foot Cone. If the basilisk sees its reflection in the Cone, the basilisk must make this save.

Second Failure: The target has the Petrified condition instead of the Restrained condition.
