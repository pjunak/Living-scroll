*Medium Monstrosity, Unaligned*

### Actions

**Bite.** Melee Attack Roll: +3, reach 5 ft. Hit: 5 (1d8 + 1) Piercing damage.

**Antennae.** The rust monster targets one nonmagical metal object—armor or a weapon—worn or carried by a creature within 5 feet of itself. Dexterity Saving Throw: DC 11, the creature with the object. Failure: The object takes a −1 penalty to the AC it offers (armor) or to its attack rolls (weapon). Armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10, and a weapon is destroyed if its penalty reaches −5. The penalty can be removed by casting the Mending spell on the armor or weapon.
